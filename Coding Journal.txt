Had my 3rd interview on Monday and it went great,
the company seems like a great fit for me and it was
a lot of fun to get to know the guys that work there!

Don't want to get my hopes up too high but this
would be a great first job for me and I see a lot of
long term opportunity at that company.

Other than that, I've got a cs 140 exam this week that
I'm prepping for and not much else this week.
