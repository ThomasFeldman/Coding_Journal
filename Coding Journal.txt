Had a great 2nd interview with PWI today,
going for a 3rd in person interview next week Monday!

Would love to work there as there seems to be a lot of
growth opportunity.

Studied A LOT for my STATS exam tomorrow, after that
I will have two CS Exams to worry about but
they shouldn't be too difficult.
