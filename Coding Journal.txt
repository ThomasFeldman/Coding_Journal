Took two quizzes today, went well. Did some CS 155 worksheets about the
Visual Studio IDE. Going to do some readings later tonight.

Found a book online that was used in SIUE's Discrete Math class so I can read that
in my spare time! That should be the last math I need for the BA but I may take a calc course this summer.
